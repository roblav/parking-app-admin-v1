//Update Car Owner by Id

As an admin I want to be able to update a CarOwners ID.
Currently we can't update a users ID. We only have POST /parking endpoint, which takes a CarParking object and does both the PUT and the UPDATE. If we change a CarOwner id a new CarOwner is created.

//Form validation

The [disabled]="!ngForm.valid" was interferring with the dismiss modal call. So, when saving data the form would not close. For now I've removed the disable save button option.

//Search Car Registration

The API doesn't return the Vehicle details.
